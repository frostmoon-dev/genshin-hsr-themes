Refining Columbina's Dark Theme to eliminate "jank" and better reflect her character.

1.  **Objective**: Create a theme that feels like "Columbina" – mysterious, elegant, dangerous but soft.
2.  **Changes**:
    *   **Background**: Shift from muddy purple `#29202C` to a **Deep Mystical Charcoal/Plum `#1a161b`**. This is much darker and neutral but retains a hint of purple warmth.
    *   **Foreground**: Use **Moonlight White `#e5e1e6`** for high readability and ethereal vibe.
    *   **Accents**:
        *   **Primary**: **Vibrant Magenta `#894378`** for key interactions (but used sparingly to avoid cheapness).
        *   **Secondary**: **Soft Periwinkle ` #9DA9E6`** for syntax/info to add that "angelic" touch without being too blue.
    *   **UI Harmony**: Darker sidebars/activity bars `#141115` to frame the editor and make the content pop.

3.  **Verification**: Check contrast ratios and overall "vibe" to ensure it matches the "Damselette" aesthetic.
